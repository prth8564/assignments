			<h2>Sedan</h2>
			a passenger vehicle in a three-box design with four doors and a separate trunk. The trunk of the sedan car is normally separate from the rest of the model by the rear seatback as well as an immovable package tray under the rear window. However, some models do come with a foldable rear seatback so that it can open a pass-through for the larger cargo that wouldn’t really fit in the trunk itself.

			<h2>Hatchback</h2>
			Compared with sedans, deciding on what is or what isn’t a hatchback car is not as easy. Basically, a hatchback is also a small passenger car that may look similar to a sedan but instead of a separate trunk, it comes with a hatch-type rear door. That said, the hatch can be open upward so you can access the entire backend of the cabin. Most of the times, it offers fold-down rear seats so that one can gain larger storage space in the vehicle.

			<h2>SUV</h2>
			A sport utility vehicle or SUV is a car classification that combines elements of road-going passenger cars with features from off-road vehicles, such as raised ground clearance and four-wheel drive. There is no commonly agreed-upon definition of an SUV, and usage of the term varies between countries.
